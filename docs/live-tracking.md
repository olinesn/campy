# Live tracking with campy-live

Three programs work together on the computer that records:

- **`campy-acquire`** records the cameras as usual. With `liveFeed: True` it also copies each frame into shared memory, the *live feed*.
- **`campy-live`** reads the feed and runs a sleap-nn top-down model on each synchronized set of frames, one frame per camera. With a calibration, it also matches the animals across cameras, keeps their identities and triangulates them in 3D. It is never more than one set behind: a set that arrives while it is busy is skipped and counted, never queued.
- **`campy-live-view`** (optional) shows the camera frames with the tracking drawn on them, plus a 3D view.

campy never waits for `campy-live`, so tracking can't slow down or break a recording. The [main README](../README.md#live-pose-estimation-livefeed-campy-live) lists every option.

## Two Python environments

The recording and the inference run in separate environments, because one needs camera drivers and the other needs torch:

- **Recording**: campy's usual environment ([Installation](../README.md#installation)), with Spinnaker/PySpin for FLIR cameras.
- **Inference**: Python 3.12 with a GPU build of torch, `sleap-nn` 0.3.3, OpenCV (`opencv-python`) for the view, and optionally `PyQt5` for the view's Qt window. Install campy into it without its dependencies, so the camera drivers aren't needed there:
  ```
  pip install --no-deps -e <campy folder>
  ```
  `campy-live` imports only numpy and campy's own feed modules, besides torch and sleap-nn.

Which torch build:
- **Linux, AMD GPU (ROCm)**: a ROCm build for your GPU. The EVO-X2's Radeon 8060S (gfx1151) used AMD's own torch wheels (torch 2.14.0+rocm10.1.0).
- **Windows, NVIDIA GPU (CUDA)**: a CUDA build, for example `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`.

## Recording with live tracking

1. **Start `campy-live` first**, in the inference environment:
   ```
   campy-live --cameras 3 --model sleap --centroid <centroid model folder> --instance <centered-instance model folder> \
       --animals 5 --calibration calibration.toml
   ```
   It loads the models and warms them up before any frame exists, then prints `Waiting for the live feed`. On a computer with performance and efficiency cores (Intel Core Ultra and 12th-generation Core or later) it first moves itself onto the performance cores at High priority, and once the feed appears it moves campy-acquire, its camera processes and their encoders onto the efficiency cores (see below, On Windows). The wait is 5–8 s on the EVO-X2 and up to about 18 s on Windows, mostly imports. It assumes 1280 × 1024 grey frames. For other cameras, give `--frame-shape <height>x<width>x<channels>`, or it builds the model again when the frames arrive and misses the first seconds.
2. **Start the recording** with the live feed on:
   ```
   campy-acquire <config>.yaml --liveFeed True
   ```
   Because `campy-live` is already waiting, it analyses the recording from the first frame.
3. **Optionally, watch it** in the inference environment:
   ```
   campy-live-view
   ```
   It runs as a separate program at low priority and stays open from one recording to the next. Its `c` key, or the "Fast CPUs" box in its panel, moves `campy-live` on and off the performance cores while both run, and the panel shows `campy-live`'s inference time over the last 2 s, so you can see the difference. On a computer without a screen (over SSH), `campy-live-view --no-window --png <folder>` saves pictures instead.

`campy-live` ends with the recording, or at Ctrl-C. It writes `campy-live_<date_time>.npy`, with one row per set processed (keypoints, confidences, and the 3D poses and identities with `--calibration`), and a `.json` summary.

## Checking that it keeps up

The summary, and the reports it prints every 10 s, give the sets processed and skipped, the inference time per set and the latency from frames to keypoints and to 3D. At 60 fps a set must take less than 16.7 ms, and at 30 fps less than 33.3 ms.

- **Sets skipped through the whole recording**: the model is too slow for this machine and frame rate. Choose a lighter one ([Models](models.md)).
- **A few skipped in the first fraction of a second**: the GPU was still at its idle clock when the frames came. `campy-live` holds the GPU's clock up from the moment the feed appears (`--hold-gpu-clock`, on by default with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs), so this should no longer happen.
- **"misaligned" sets**: one camera's frames reached the computer late, or a camera lost a frame (`flirFramesLost` in its `metadata.csv`). See the README on frame numbers.

For a test without animals or without a trained model, `--model random` runs untrained models of the benchmark's default sizes, and `--model none` only reads the feed.

## On Linux (AMD, ROCm)

- **First use of a model**: AMD's MIOpen library tunes every new convolution shape the first time it sees it, so the first warm-up of a new model can take about 10 s. The tuning is cached for later runs.
- **Disk stalls**: some SSDs stop completing writes for 10–16 s. The EVO-X2's config (`configs/campy_config_evox2.yaml`) holds up to 60 s of frames in memory (`writeQueueMaxSec: 60`) so a stall drops nothing. Better still, record to a second drive.
- **Encoding**: VA-API runs on the same GPU as inference. On the EVO-X2 that cost inference only a few percent.

## On Windows (NVIDIA, CUDA)

- **Sleep**: campy keeps Windows awake while it records (`keepAwake`, on by default). If campy is started over SSH while nobody is signed in, Windows refuses the screen part of that request: set the screen timeout to Never as well (Settings > System > Power).
- **Encoding on the Intel iGPU** (Quick Sync, `gpuMake: "intel"`) keeps the encoder off the inference GPU.
- **The GPU's clock**: an NVIDIA GPU chooses its own clock speed from how busy it looks. Live tracking gives it a short burst of work for each frame, and that didn't look busy: on the Pro Max Slim's RTX 2000 Ada the clock sat at 780 MHz of its 2,500 while tracking, and fell to 210 MHz while `campy-live` waited for the recording to start. So `campy-live` keeps a tiny piece of the GPU busy, at the lowest priority, from the moment the feed appears until it ends (`--hold-gpu-clock`, on by default with NVIDIA GPUs). The models' work goes first, so it isn't slowed. That took the time per set from 27.6 to 13.2 ms with 3 mice in view, so the same models now fit 60 fps, and the first sets of a recording are no longer slow. The cost is about 20 W more while waiting. `--hold-gpu-clock off` turns it off. While the frames come, `campy-live` reads the GPU's clock every half second and spins 0, 1 or 2 blocks, as many as keep the clock up (`--hold-gpu-clock-blocks auto`, or a fixed number): one block costs the models about 0.3 ms per set, so none spin when the GPU keeps its clock by itself, as the Pro Max Slim's card did right after a restart. It reads the clock through NVIDIA's NVML (the `nvidia-ml-py` package, if installed in campy-live's environment), else `nvidia-smi`, and on AMD from the driver. AMD's GPUs slow down too, less: the EVO-X2's ran the default models at 2,117 of its 2,900 MHz, 9.9 ms per set instead of 8.9, so the hold is on there by default as well.
- **Hybrid Intel CPUs**: `campy-live` runs itself on the performance cores at High priority, and moves campy-acquire's camera processes and encoders onto the efficiency cores when their feed appears (`--cpus auto`, `--priority auto` and `--campy-cpus auto`, the defaults). With 3 cameras recording, that saved about 2 ms per set. `python -m campy.cpus` lists which cores are which. `--cpus none --campy-cpus none` leaves both programs where Windows puts them. The move needs a campy-acquire from this version on, whose live feed reports its processes; with an older one, `campy-live` says so and leaves campy-acquire alone.
- **CUDA graphs** (`--cuda-graphs`, off by default): each model's GPU work is recorded once and then replayed in one go. The keypoints are identical; on the RTX 2000 Ada it saved about 0.8 ms per set (13.2 to 12.4 ms with 3 mice). Each number of animals found gets its own graph, and `campy-live` doesn't yet share GPU memory between them: in the benchmark on the RTX 6000 Ada, 28 graphs at 8 cameras held 8.1 GB without sharing and 1.4 GB with it.
- **channels-last** memory layout is the default on NVIDIA GPUs (`--memory-format auto`), and is faster there.
- **A monitor** plugged into the inference GPU slowed it noticeably. If the machine has two GPUs, plug the monitor into the other one.
